  utter_greet:
  - text: Hello! How can I help you?
  utter_intro:
  - text: First let me introduce myself, my name is BrainBot. I hope to be able to help you prepare for your upcoming interview. I am still in development, and as such, I have some limitations, I may not always understand what you're saying properly, so it would be really helpful if you could speak slowly and try to articulate. Please try to treat this as your interview.
  utter_ask_hs:
  - text: Please start by telling me what you liked most about math class in highschool?
  utter_ask_passion:
  - text: Interesting. Can you tell me about anything that you have done that would demonstrate your passion for mechanical engineering?
  utter_ask_interest:
  - text: That sounds amazing. Please explain which features of the mechanical engineering course at Imperial attracted you and why?
  utter_ask_future:
  - text: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
  utter_ask_extra:
  - text: That's an awesome plan! Could you tell me about any extra-curricular activities that you were involved in, that demonstrates that you will be a great addition to our student community?
  utter_ask_startmath:
  - text: Fantastic! I am done asking you questions for today. Let's try to solve the following math problem now. \n A pipeline is to be run from an oil refinery on a river bank to a set of storage tanks which lie on the other side of the river. The pipeline is to be built so that the overland portion follows the river bank and then crosses beneath the river along a straight path. The river is 3 km wide and the tanks are 6 km downriver from the refinery. It costs £1200k per km to run the pipeline under the river and £960k per km to run the pipeline over land. Find out the length of the pipeline being above the river so as to minimize the total cost of construction. \n {{img:https://rasastorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/question.jpg}} \n Let me know if you're done by saying "done" or if you need any help by saying "help".
  utter_ask_help:
  - text: Let me know if you're done by saying "done" or if you need any help by saying "help".
  utter_ask_math1:
  - text: Ok, let's see where you got stuck. Did you start by putting the problem into equations?
  utter_ask_math2:
  - text: We can first simply the problem using the following figure. \n {{img:https://rasastorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/question-x.jpg}} \n Please check that your equations are correct. \n {{img:https://rasastorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/equation.jpg}}. \n Now you need to identify the minimum of a function. Did you do that?
  utter_ask_math3:
  - text: Let's check that your first derivative is correct. \n {{img:https://rasastorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/derivative1.jpg}} \n This is the last piece of advice that I can give you. Let me know when you're done and ready to give me your solution by saying "done".
#  utter_ask_math4:
#  - text: Let's check your second derivative.
  utter_ask_mathdone1:
  - text: ok, great! Please give me the answer you found to the problem by saying the numerical value.
  utter_ask_mathdone2:
  - text: Can you walk me through your reasoning?
  utter_ask_no1:
  - text: Why don't you try doing that on your own and let me know if you need extra help for the next steps by saying "help", if you found the solution, say "done".
  utter_ask_no2:
  - text: Try to take the derivative of your function to find the minimum. Let me know if you need help again by saying "help", if you found the solution, say "done".
#  utter_ask_no3:
#  - text: Why don't you keep trying a little on your own and let me know if you need extra help by saying "help", if you found the solution, say "done".
  utter_done:
  - text: Lovely. We have reached the end of our practice session. I have generated some feedback for you. Hope this can be useful and that you have enjoyed practicing with me today. Feel free to try the practice again, using your id, at any time. If you have any questions or concerns or have encountered any issue during the session, please email us at interviewbot@ic.ac.uk. Thanks for your participation!
